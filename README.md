# coreaudio-device-management
- this is a small experiment in working with apple's core audio to listen to changes in the system preference device settings.

- this is also part of a larger, personal project I am working on which aims to wrap a lot of the core audio functionality into a simpler and more intuitive package...

open to changes, suggestions and use cases in the discussions section :)
